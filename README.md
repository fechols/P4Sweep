**High-performance Perforce file integrity verification. (So fast it's unreal!)**

Are you working on a large project in Perforce with GB of binary data?

Would you like to know whether the local copy on your drive is valid?

P4Sweep checks every file in your local depot tree and confirms the MD5 hash matches the authoritative hash stored on the Perforce server. (Like "p4 clean", but multithreaded and with an optional GUI.)

This tool is 10x faster than "p4 clean" on a system with 16+ cores and a high-quality SSD.
